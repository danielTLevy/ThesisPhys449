  abstract={The paper opens with a brief review of the original discovery of the radiation and the physical principles of the process that gives rise to it. This is followed by an elementary account of the theory of the effect. A general survey of the practical applications to cosmic-ray and high-energy physics is then presented, with two examples of modern detectors discussed in greater detail. The article concludes with an account of recent experiments carried out on light pulses from the night-sky associated with cosmic-ray showers, found to be due to Cerenkov radiation in the atmosphere.}

We discuss the differences arising between the consistent combination of the data samples from accelerator and reactor experiments compared to partial combinations. We quantify the confidence in the determination of the less precisely known parameters $\theta$23, $\delta$CP, and the neutrino mass ordering by performing a Monte Carlo study of the long baseline accelerator and reactor data. We find that the sensitivity to the mass ordering and the $\theta$23 octant is below 1$\sigma$. Maximal $\theta$23 mixing is allowed at slightly more than 90{\%} CL. The best fit for the CP violating phase is around 270{\textdegree}, CP conservation is allowed at slightly above 1$\sigma$, and values of $\delta$CP ≃ 90{\textdegree} are disfavored at around 99{\%} CL for normal ordering and higher CL for inverted ordering.",

These transparent aerogel tiles will be installed in a Cherenkov detector for the next-generation accelerator-based particle physics experiment Belle II, to be performed at the High Energy Accelerator Research Organization (KEK) in Japan. Cracking has been eliminated from the prototype aerogel tiles by improving the supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) extraction procedure when drying the wet gel tiles. Finally, a method of mass-producing aerogel tiles for the actual detector was established. It was confirmed that the experimentally manufactured aerogel tiles meet the required optical and hydrophobic characteristics and have a uniform tile density."

abstract="In 1934 P. A. {\v{C}}erenkov has discovered a peculiar phenomenon, whicd he has since investigated in detail (1). All liquids and solids if bombarded by fast electrons, such as $\beta$-electrons or Compton electrons produced by $\gamma$-rays, do emit a peculiar visible radiation, quite different from the eventual ordinary flourescence. This radiation is partially polarized, the electric oscillation vector being parallel to the electron beam, and its intensity can be reduced neither by temperature nor by addition to the liquid bombarded of quenching substances. The peculiarity of these carac-teristics was scrutinized by Wawilow (2) who suggested that this radiation must be connected with the «Bremsung» of fast electrons. Since then a new and undoubtedly the most peculiar characteristic of the phenomenon was discovered, namely, its highly pronounced asymmetry, the intensity of light emitted, in the direction of the motion of electrons being many times larger than in the backward direction. It follows that the substance bombarded radiates coherently for the space of at least one wavelength of the visible light.",

This book continues the gradually modernizing treatment of the previous edition by imparting an appreciation of the central role of atomic scattering, providing an understanding of the insightful perspective offered by the Fourier Theory, and by, from the outset, explicating the underlying quantum mechanical nature of light.

It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics."

abstract = "Taking into account the recent progress in the understanding of the lepton flavor effects in leptogenesis, we investigate in detail the possibility that the CP-violation necessary for the generation of the baryon asymmetry of the Universe is due exclusively to the Dirac and/or Majorana CP-violating phases in the PMNS neutrino mixing matrix U, and thus is directly related to the low energy CP-violation in the lepton sector (e.g., in neutrino oscillations, etc.). We first derive the conditions of CP-invariance of the neutrino Yukawa couplings λ in the see-saw Lagrangian, and of the complex orthogonal matrix R in the “orthogonal” parametrization of λ. We show, e.g. that under certain conditions (i) real R and specific CP-conserving values of the Majorana and Dirac phases can imply CP-violation, and (ii) purely imaginary R does not necessarily imply breaking of CP-symmetry. We study in detail the case of hierarchical heavy Majorana neutrino mass spectrum, presenting results for three possible types of light neutrino mass spectrum: (i) normal hierarchical, (ii) inverted hierarchical, and (iii) quasi-degenerate. Results in the alternative case of quasi-degenerate in mass heavy Majorana neutrinos, are also derived. The minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard theory with right-handed Majorana neutrinos and see-saw mechanism of neutrino mass generation is discussed as well. We illustrate the possible correlations between the baryon asymmetry of the Universe and (i) the rephasing invariant JCP controlling the magnitude of CP-violation in neutrino oscillations, or (ii) the effective Majorana mass in neutrinoless double beta decay, in the cases when the only source of CP-violation is respectively the Dirac or the Majorana phases in the neutrino mixing matrix."

title={The DUNE Far Detector Interim Design Report Volume 1: Physics, Technology and Strategies},

abstract={The DUNE IDR describes the proposed physics program and technical designs of the DUNE Far Detector modules in preparation for the full TDR to be published in 2019. It is intended as an intermediate milestone on the path to a full TDR, justifying the technical choices that flow down from the high-level physics goals through requirements at all levels of the Project. These design choices will enable the DUNE experiment to make the ground-breaking discoveries that will help to answer fundamental physics questions. Volume 1 contains an executive summary that describes the general aims of this document. The remainder of this first volume provides a more detailed description of the DUNE physics program that drives the choice of detector technologies. It also includes concise outlines of two overarching systems that have not yet evolved to consortium structures: computing and calibration. Volumes 2 and 3 of this IDR describe, for the single-phase and dual-phase technologies, respectively, each detector module's subsystems, the technical coordination required for its design, construction, installation, and integration, and its organizational structure.},

These measurements are fundamental to reduce the uncertainties on the neutrino flux at the T2K experiment. The procedure used to tune the T2K flux prediction with the measured spectra is explained as well."

Its determination would represent an important step in the formulation of the generalized model, and would have a profound impact on the quest of the nature of neutrinos (Dirac or Majorana) and the search for a theory of flavor. In this review, we summarize the status of experimental and theoretical work in this field and explore the future opportunities that emerge in light of the recently discovered non-zero and relatively large third neutrino mixing angle θ13."
