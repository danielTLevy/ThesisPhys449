\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:Discussion}
In this section, I will talk about the viability of this likelihood approach for use in particle separation - under what circumstances does it work well, what are its limitations, how we could improve those limitiations. At this time, I do not yet have enough results to say what these are. I also do not know how much I will be able to complete - if I do not manage to implement some improvement to the simulation, I may add it here. Possible things to talk about:
\begin{itemize}
\item The effectiveness at higher angles. If I find that this method is ineffective at distinguishing particles at high angles, I could talk about recommendations of what to do.
\item I could talk about how the method becomes exponentially slower the more particles are involved, as the fit becomes multidimensional.
\item If I do not have time to parallelize the code, I could talk about how I would do that, and what benefits that would give.
\item If the code is not acceptably fast even with parallelization, I could talk about alternate approaches: for example, precomputing different photon distributions and interpolating them.
\end{itemize}

You could put scraps here or things in progress.
