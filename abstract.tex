\chapter{Abstract}

In next-generation accelerator-based neutrino detectors such as Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE, one of the leading sources of uncertainties lies in the calculations of neutrino flux. The EMPHATIC experiment aims to improve calculations of neutrino flux by measuring hadron production resulting from a test proton beam hitting a variety of targets. EMPHATIC includes an Aerogel Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector, which uses the distribution of detected photons resulting from Cherenkov radiation in order to determine particle velocity. I intend to create a Monte Carlo simulation of particles travelling through the detector, and simulate the propagation of the generated Cherenkov radiation. Using a likelihood approach, evaluation of the simulated photon distributions will allow for the identification of particles. Following this, I intend to simulate different variants of the detector configuration to maximize the detector's ability to discriminate particles.
