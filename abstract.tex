\chapter{Abstract}

In next-generation accelerator-based neutrino detectors such as Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE, one of the leading sources of uncertainties lies in the calculations of neutrino flux.
The \ac{EMPHATIC} aims to improve calculations of neutrino flux by measuring hadron production resulting from a test proton beam hitting a variety of targets.
\ac{EMPHATIC} includes an Aerogel Ring Imaging Cherenkov detector, which uses the distribution of detected photons resulting from Cherenkov radiation in order to determine particle velocity.
A Monte Carlo simulation is created of particles travelling through the detector, and the propagation of the generated Cherenkov radiation is simulated.
Using a likelihood approach, evaluation of the simulated photon distributions allows for the identification of particles.
