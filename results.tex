\begin{itemize}
\item Comparison between my simulation and Geant4: 
In This section, I will compare the simulated photon distribution between my simulation and the full GEANT4 simulation. I will compare the number of photons generated, the spectrum of the detected photons, the r value and ratio of the centered-beam simulations, and visually compare the angled simulation.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Ratio of histograms, difference of histograms
	\item Comparison of features that are lacking
	\end{itemize}
\item Particle separation
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Idea behind how this separation is useful
	\item Different particles
	\item Effect of different momenta
	\item Effect of different angles
	\end{itemize}
\item Beta Fitting
\item 
\end{itemize}
