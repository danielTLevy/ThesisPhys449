\chapter{Simulation Code}

\TODO{
In this section, I will briefly document the code: How to get it running, what inputs it takes in, what classes are included, and how each component interacts with one another. 
}

The full code repository is available at \url{https://github.com/danielTLevy/ARICHSim} \TODO{do I link this from my own personal (public) repository, or the private EMPHATICSoft repository?}
