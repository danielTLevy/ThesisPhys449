\chapter{Acknowledgments}
I would first like to thank my supervisor, Dr. Mark Hartz, for all his guidance in planning out this project, his input and feedback at every step of the way, and for giving me the fantastic opportunity to work with the neutrino group at TRIUMF. I would like to thank Dr. Matej Pavin for his help with all my ROOT and Geant4 questions and issues, for helping me learn more about the context of the EMPHATIC experiment, and for his feedback on this thesis as a second reader. I would also like to express my appreciation for the rest of the EMPHATIC group as well as the students of PHYS 449 for their great questions and feedback during the presentations I gave, and I would like to thank Dr. Rob Kiefl for his invaluable work with organizing the class and for always being available for any questions and concerns.
